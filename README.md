10/8/20 - Problem with Nodemailer smtp protocol when deployed to remote server.

### About
A full stack development using MERN framework - ReactJS, Express, NodeJS, and MongoDB - of an online bookstore with book reservation system, integrating Google Books API and utilising Python for processing and pushing real stock data to cloud db. Some libraries and frameworks used: *PyMongo* and *python-firebase* for Python utility scripts; *Redux-persist*, *Axios*, and *Semantic-UI* for React; *Mongoose* and *MongoDB Atlas* for *MongoDB*; *Passport-local*, *Passport-jwt*, and *Nodemailer* for Node; Postman for API testing - as part of the university's senior project. <br/>

Note: Had the circumstances been different than what had essentially transpired during the period, I would rather essay an equally impossible feat of writing an A.I. that can generate Reutersv√§rd's brilliant style of impossible figures.
